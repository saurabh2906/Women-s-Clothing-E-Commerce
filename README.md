# Women-s-Clothing-E-Commerce
This is a Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers. Its eleven supportive features offer a great environment to parse out the text through its multiple dimensions. I use various methods and try to predict the customer sentiment from reviews. As you can guess, there are various methods to succeed this and each method has pros and cons. I think Naive Bayes is one of the most important methods in text mining because it is the fastest. However, if we do not have a very large dataset or have high CPU power, the others might be useful too. Here, I started with examining the data and use some charts to reach more insights. Afterwards, I applied different models and compared them from various aspects. Total reviews collect on the basis of 11 features are 19662. That means a total of 19662 records were gathered which is now analysed using NLP mechanisms
