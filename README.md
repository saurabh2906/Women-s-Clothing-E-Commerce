# Women-s-Clothing-E-Commerce
This is a Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers. Its eleven supportive features offer a great environment to parse out the text through its multiple dimensions. I use various methods and try to predict the customer sentiment from reviews. As you can guess, there are various methods to succeed this and each method has pros and cons. I think Naive Bayes is one of the most important methods in text mining because it is the fastest. However, if we do not have a very large dataset or have high CPU power, the others might be useful too. Here, I started with examining the data and use some charts to reach more insights. Afterwards, I applied different models and compared them from various aspects. Total reviews collect on the basis of 11 features are 19662. That means a total of 19662 records were gathered which is now analysed using NLP mechanisms.

Conclusion : When we look at the results of the all evaluation metrics in the evaluating models section, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression gives the best results for our analysis. Thus, both of them are very effective at predicting sentiment. 

On the other hand, it seems that Naive Bayes takes less time and when we have a bigger dataset, this difference might increase and be an important advantage .
